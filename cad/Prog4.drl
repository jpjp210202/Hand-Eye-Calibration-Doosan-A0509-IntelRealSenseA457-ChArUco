  #--------------------------
  # Add your default header and subprograms here
  # For example, to drive a gripper as a program call:
  # def Gripper_Open():
  #   set_digital_output(3, 1)
  #
  # def Gripper_Close():
  #   set_digital_output(3, 0)
  #
  # Example to drive a spray gun:
  def SprayOn(value):
    # use the value as an output:
    DO_SPRAY = 5
    if value == 0:
      set_digital_output(DO_SPRAY, 0)
    else:
      set_digital_output(DO_SPRAY, 1)
